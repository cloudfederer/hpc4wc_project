MPI version of GT4Py code: Merge your work from MPI parallelization into the gt4py version and make sure that all code is ported using gt4py (including halo-updates). This code will be able to fully leverage the Piz Daint supercomputer, wohoo! Analyze and optimize its performance and do a weak and strong scaling investigation on Piz Daint for different backends.
